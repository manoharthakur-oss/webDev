FLEXBOX

- this is the one of the newest feature in CSS.
- it helps to adapt elements in different size and shape of screens.
- to apply flex box we have to make sure that we have a parent and child elements in it.
- FLEX-CONTAINER : the parent element.
- FLEX ITEMS: items inside flex container.
- initial code
<!doctype html>
<html>
 <head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
 </head>
 <body>
  <div class="container">
   <div class="item">1</div>
   <div class="item">2</div>
   <div class="item">3</div>
   <div class="item">4</div>
  </div>
 </body>
</html>

- to apply flex box we have to set
	DISPLAY=FLEX of FLEX-CONTAINER
- 


display:flex;

- by default flexbox try to put all the the elements in one row.
- flex item automatically stretch to fill their container height.
- flex items are as wide as content inside them.
- flex item can shrink their width so they can fit in 1 row of the container.
- sometime flex item has content inside them that cannot be broken.
	for example a long word.
- in that case if the width of flex item is greater than width of container
	then flex item overflow outside the container.
- flip box effect the inline and blocked items in same way.
	for example if we put a button inside flexbox having height 100
	then the height of button will automatically become hundred.
- flexbox is the first step to make our web page responsive.
