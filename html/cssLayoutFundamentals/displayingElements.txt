- to change the way how element look we have to just change display property in CSS stylesheet.

- Headings and paragraph a line by line.
- buttons and links appear in a same row.
- display property decides whether or not element appear on a same line.
- for "a" elements display default value is inline.
- height and width don't work on inline elements. as they wrap the content inside them.
- examples of inline elements are a, strong, li and em . they all appear in same line when coded after each other. 
- NORMAL FLOW : the way elements display on the web page by default.

>>>>>>>>>>>>
DISPLAY: BLOCK;

- elements like "p","div","h3" are different from inline elements.
- they appear line by line.
- destek entire width of their parent.
- display: block;
- 

- elements like images and buttons have different display layout that is inline-block.
- INLINE-BLOCK:
	- this allowed us to put element in same line.
	- and also we can change the size of elements.
	- examples are buttons and images.
	- when we change the size of an inline block element:
		the size changes. it is the the one of the features of inline block elements.
	- example if we change the display value of all div elements: to inline block
		they all will appear in a same line
