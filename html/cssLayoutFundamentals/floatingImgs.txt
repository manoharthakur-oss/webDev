FLOATING IMAGES: images with text wrap around them.

how to make floating images?
- first display image then a text below it.
- now we can set float property to left and right.
- now in the next line if we do not want it takes to wrap around image:
	in that case we set elements clear property to same as that of image above.

#clearProperty

- we can add this property to the element we do not want to wrap around image.
