GROUPING THE SELECTORS
- 
- suppose we have to set same text style for all buttons and paragraphs
- one option is we manually set those by different selectors of button and paragraph respectively.
- are instead of using new rule we can use same rule for two elements.
- two selectors must be, separated.
- example: p , button {
						color: black;
						}
- this will help us to group different elements under same rule.
- we can use any kind of selector example ".abc"
- we can add as many selector we want.
- #styling multiple element with same rule.
