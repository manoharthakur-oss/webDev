while (true) {
 console.log("and again");
}
- while loop in JavaScript is same as Java.
- we should remember that code inside curly braces "{}" is called code block.

STOPPING A WHILE LOOP:
	- first we create a variable outside while loop.
	- no use that variable in condition of while loop.
	- and inside the code block of while loop which is the value of variable
		in such a way that condition of while loop will become false
		and the loop will terminate.
	
	NOTE - WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IF THERE IS NO VARIABLE IN CONDITION
			then the loop will run forever.
